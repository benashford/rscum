- Test different similarity functions
  - Dice's coefficient (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dice%27s_coefficient)
  - Overlap coefficient (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlap_coefficient)
  - Sorensen similarity index (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B8rensen_similarity_index)
- Test different "normalisation" methods
- Investigate the damping of the dimension flattening
- Consider a "distance from centre score" (those at centre are likely to be Jack-of-all-Trades, those at edge aren't interested in anything...)
- Investigate angular clustering
- k-means angular clustering
- Correct Jaccard implementation doesn't use square root
